# Webradio-API
A minimal multi-service oriented search and streaming API for your Multi Theft Auto server

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need a web server like *nginx* or *apache* with PHP. The web server should serve content from the `public` directory and not anywhere else to reduce the attack margin to a minimum. Due to the early stages of the project you are forced to use `>= PHP 7` because the code uses e.g. the *null coalesce* operator, which was first introduced in PHP 7.

### Installing
Clone the repository to your disk, copy the `config.example.php` file as `config.php` in the *root*-directory and open it in an editor of your choice.

Remove the default key in the `$keys` array and add your own secret key strings to the array. There is no character limit on the keys and  you can use any character, whitespace too. Example:
```php
$keys = [
    "2JXR861JPWJ1CENHF51WA3QF3UK1I1QA", // You shouldn't use this one
    "9LRAP2PIJRCDYTQL5844O2VV2QX3TCQ6", // Neither this one
    // ...
];
```

Finally, you should add your private API keys for `YouTube`, `Soundcloud` and `Jamendo`. Other included services do not require an API key.

**Note:** You MUST configure your webserver to point to the `public` directory of the application.

#### Shortcuts for API registration
* [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application#Create_API_Keys)
* [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps)
* [Jamendo](https://devportal.jamendo.com/admin/applications)

### Development
You should set the `$debug_mode` variable in `config.php` to *true* if you want to receive the fine details of the exception whenever your application drops an `Out of Order` error.

### Troubleshooting
#### Permission denied for mkdir()
Make sure your webserver user has enough permissions for writing in the **/storage** (sub-)directories.

## Usage
### Search
`/search.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=YouTube&query=Bohemian+Rhapsody`  
`/search.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=Soundcloud&query=Adele+Hello`  
`/search.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=Jamendo&query=Sunshine`  
`/search.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=MyFreeMP3&query=We+Right+Here`  
`/search.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=MP3Library&query=Bob+Dylan`  

### Stream
`/stream.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=Soundcloud&id=<song id>`  
`/stream.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=Jamendo&id=<song id>`  
`/stream.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=MyFreeMP3&id=<song id>`  
`/stream.php?key=<a key from $keys>&service=MP3Library&id=<song id>`  
*Note: YouTube is not supported yet.*
